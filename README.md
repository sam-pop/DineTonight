# DineTonight

Since my wife can never decide where to go out to eat - I'm building a MERN app that picks a highly rated (pseudo)random restaurant within a selected range (with the option to specify a cuisine).

You can store the places you visited/liked and write notes on them describing the experience for your future self.

And don't worry, I'll add user auth so you can create a user and use it too :)
