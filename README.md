# [WIP] DineTonight

Since my wife can never decide where she wants to go out to eat - I'm building a MERN app (mobile first design) that automatically picks a highly-rated (pseudo)random restaurant near your current location.

You can store the places you visited/liked and write notes on them describing the experience for your future-self.

And don't worry, I'll add user auth so you can create a user and use it too :)
